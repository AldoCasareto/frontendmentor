          Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical
          features are the powerful webbed feet used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding
          breath underwater.

          More importantly, otters are glorious water dogs, playful and curious. The otter, no
          other, is the best animal.
